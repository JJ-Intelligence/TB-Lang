-- Challenge 10

fib = [1, 1]; -- List to store fib elements in

-- Keep iterating until out of input
for (i = 1; hasElems(i, in(0)); i++) {

    -- Look at the first i elements, but don't remove from stream
    xs = peekN(i, in(0));

    -- Sum up terms in sequence: fib * a_n
    sum = 0;
    for (j = 0; j < length(xs); j++) {
        sum += get(j+1, fib) * get(j, xs);
    };
    out(sum);

    -- Add next term to fib sequence
    fib = (get(0, fib) + get(1, fib)) : fib;
};
