-- Challenge 4

-- 'solve' function takes in a pointer to a stream, pops 3 elements from it, and returns a list of Ints.
type solve (*Stream) -> [Int];
func solve (*(a:b:c:ls)) = [c, 2*b, 3*a-1];

-- While there are 3 Ints in the stream, print the output of 'solve'.
while (hasElems(3, in(0))) {
    out(solve(in(0)));
};
